# CULTIVATING RESILIENCE AND WELL-BEING IN HAIRSTYLING

> Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. — James 1:2-3

## Introduction

Reflect on the passion and artistry that first drew you to hairstyling.  The moments when creativity flows, where every cut and color reflects your vision. Yet, alongside that passion often lies exhaustion from long hours, the stress of managing clients, and the pressure to constantly innovate. For freelance hairstylists, the path to success isn't always smooth. Balancing creativity with the demands of running a business can lead to burnout.

In a field that celebrates self-expression, sustaining mental and physical well-being is critical. Resilience—our ability to bounce back, adapt, and thrive through challenges—is the foundation for both long-term success and fulfillment.  Consider the journey of hairstylists like Johnny Wright (known for his work with Michelle Obama) and Tabatha Coffey (a celebrity stylist known for her television appearances).  Both navigated career challenges through self-care, commitment to growth, and community support.  Maya Smith, founder of The Doux, represents resilience and authenticity, building a brand that champions self-expression and celebrates natural hair textures.

This chapter explores strategies to build resilience through mindset shifts, goal-setting, community connections, and self-care practices. Let's explore these empowering practices to create a balanced, fulfilling career.

Take a moment to check in with yourself:

1. Do you feel emotionally drained after a typical workday?
2. Have you noticed decreased satisfaction in your styling work?
3. Are you experiencing physical symptoms like headaches, back pain, or insomnia?
4. Do you find yourself canceling personal plans due to work exhaustion?
5. Have you become more irritable with clients or colleagues?
6. Do you feel a sense of reduced accomplishment despite working hard?
7. Are you relying on unhealthy coping mechanisms (excessive caffeine, alcohol, etc.)?
8. Has your creativity or problem-solving ability decreased?

**Scoring:** If you answered "yes" to 3 or more questions, you may be experiencing early signs of burnout. If you answered "yes" to 5 or more, consider implementing the strategies in this chapter immediately and potentially seek professional support. Recognizing burnout early is the first step toward reclaiming your well-being and creative passion.


## 1. Building Resilience: Reframing Challenges with a Growth Mindset

Resilience starts with how we perceive challenges. Shifting from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset is powerful.  Psychologist Carol Dweck describes a growth mindset as seeing failures and setbacks not as limitations but as opportunities for learning. When hairstylists adopt this perspective, it becomes easier to embrace each misstep as a stepping stone to skill and self-improvement.

**Example:** Kim Kimble, known for her work with Beyoncé, viewed setbacks as learning moments, driving her to innovate and achieve career longevity. Maya Smith, founder of The Doux, views obstacles as catalysts for personal and professional growth.


> There was a time early in my career when a major setback almost derailed my confidence. I had invested months into a promotional campaign that, despite my best efforts, failed to generate the expected response. Instead of wallowing in disappointment, I reframed the experience as a vital learning opportunity.  This experience reshaped how I view challenges and solidified my belief in continuous learning.


**Practical Steps:**

1. **Self-Reflection:** Analyze challenges and ask, "What can I learn?"
2. **Seek Feedback:** Actively seek constructive feedback.
3. **Celebrate Small Wins:**  Celebrate progress to reinforce a growth-focused outlook.


## 2. Setting Purposeful Goals with the SMART Methodology

Clear goals are a lifeline in the fast-paced beauty industry. SMART goals—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound—provide a structured framework to achieve tangible progress.

**Real-World Example:** Vernon François, a celebrity stylist, credits goal-setting with helping him navigate the competitive beauty industry. He set specific goals to develop products catering to diverse hair types.


> I vividly remember the time I decided to apply the SMART goal framework to boost my freelance business. I set a very clear objective: to increase my client bookings by 20% within six months. By monitoring my progress regularly, I not only met my target but exceeded it.


**Practical Steps:**

1. **Define Specific Goals:**  Be precise and clear.
2. **Break Goals into Steps:** Outline achievable actions.
3. **Set Milestones and Track Progress:** Regularly review and celebrate achievements.
4. **Adjust and Reflect:** Re-evaluate and adjust your approach.
5. **Accountability:** Connect with a colleague for support.

> After years of relentless work, there came a moment when burnout hit me hard... I began to incorporate practices like daily mindfulness meditation, regular physical exercise, and strict boundaries between work and personal time.
