# EMBRACING ETHICS AND SUSTAINABILITY IN HAIRSTYLING

> The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.
>
> Psalm 24:1

## Introduction

Feel the salon buzz with energy, each snip and spritz contributing to your client's transformation. But with every cut and color, a new realization dawns—you're not only shaping appearances but also leaving an impact on the world beyond your salon walls. From the products used to the waste generated, your choices contribute to something larger than beauty alone.<sup>1</sup>

As awareness grows around environmental impact, hairstylists are stepping up, reshaping their craft to reflect a commitment to ethical and sustainable practices. Black-owned brands like The Lip Bar, founded by Melissa Butler, have transitioned from kitchen startups to eco-conscious powerhouses.  Known for their commitment to eco-friendly ingredients and packaging, The Lip Bar has become a sustainable trailblazer.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, Bread Beauty Supply by Maeva Heim emphasizes natural, biodegradable ingredients designed to care for textured hair while also caring for the planet.<sup>3</sup>

> I vividly remember the moment I first became aware of the environmental impact of my freelance hairstyling practices. Working independently meant I was responsible for every detail—from the energy-hungry lighting in my home studio to the disposable products used in each appointment. One evening, while reviewing my soaring energy bill, I realized that every inefficient bulb and single-use item was adding up, both in expenses and in environmental cost. That night, I sat in my makeshift office surrounded by receipts and handwritten notes, overwhelmed by the thought that my work could be more sustainable. I took my first small step by switching to LED bulbs and setting up a basic recycling system for reusable items. This modest change not only lowered my bills but also sparked a commitment to integrate eco-friendly practices into every facet of my freelance career.

Trailblazing hairstylists such as Vernon Francois, celebrated for his work with natural, textured hair, demonstrate how sustainability and beauty can coexist harmoniously. Vernon incorporates plant-based, biodegradable, and ethically sourced products, inspiring a movement of eco-conscious haircare. His approach reminds us that, as hairstylists, our influence reaches far beyond the chair.

In this chapter, we'll explore how to build eco-friendly salon environments, maintain integrity through transparency, and use your role as a stylist to advocate for industry-wide sustainability.  You'll learn how to amplify your impact, aligning your business with practices that serve both your clients and the planet.  Are you ready to join these pioneers and shape the future of hairstyling, one green choice at a time?

Beginning your sustainability journey doesn't require a complete overhaul. These simple changes can make an immediate impact:

1. Switch to LED lighting in your workspace.
2. Use microfiber towels instead of disposable ones.
3. Install a programmable thermostat.
4. Create designated recycling bins.
5. Switch to concentrated products.
6. Opt for digital consultations and receipts.
7. Use refillable containers for styling products.

Remember: Sustainability is a journey, not a destination.


## I. Cultivating Eco-Friendly Salon Environments

Building an eco-friendly salon begins with energy usage, waste reduction, and sourcing environmentally responsible products.

### 1. Implementing Energy-Efficient Equipment and Renewable Power Sources

Imagine a salon where every piece of equipment hums with energy-efficient precision. Salons like Greener Salon & Spa in New York have made this vision a reality by switching to solar power and using energy-efficient lighting.<sup>4</sup>

> Before I discovered energy-efficient tools, I relied on older, power-hungry equipment that drove up my operational costs and subtly diminished the client experience in my home-based studio.  A fellow freelance stylist recommended trying a new energy-efficient hair dryer known for its low power consumption and quiet operation. I hesitated at first due to the upfront investment and the learning curve, but once I made the switch, I was amazed. Not only did my energy bills drop noticeably, but clients also remarked on the gentler, quieter experience during their sessions.

Incorporating eco-friendly equipment makes a significant impact. Brands like Bio Ionic and Shark HyperAIR offer energy-efficient styling tools.  Investing in LED lighting reduces energy consumption and provides better illumination.
